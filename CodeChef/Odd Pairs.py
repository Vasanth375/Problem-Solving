n = 199

# this formula calculates the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n without explicitly adding them one by one.
# It is an optimized approach to compute the result in constant time, regardless of the value of n. In your case,
# it will give the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 199.
count = (n * (n)) // 2
print(count)
